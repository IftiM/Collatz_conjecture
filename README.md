# Collatz_conjecture

From Wikipedia: The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that 
concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. 
Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note from Self:

Tried to make a graph showing the andulation of the nubers going up and down,
until they all coems down to 1. Certain numbers taked quite long to reach
back to 1, while some others are quite straight forward.

One thing I found really interesting: when tried to run several graphs on a
lets say 15 consecutive numbers, there are some instances that the maximum
number that it reached during the plotting graphs, are same some multiple
values.

For example for numbers 108, 109 & 110: they all had exactly the same maximum
value. When tried numbers 77 to 97, look at the numbers below. They all 
came down to 1 eventually, taking somewhat different routes, but reaching
the same maximum peak.



Starting number: 94
Total number of steps = 106
Maximum value reached 9,232
Starting number: 95
Total number of steps = 106
Maximum value reached 9,232
Starting number: 96
Total number of steps = 13
Maximum value reached 96
Starting number: 97
Total number of steps = 119
Maximum value reached 9,232
